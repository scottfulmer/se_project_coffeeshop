Practicum Coffee Shop
this project highlights the correct use of HTML format and following BEM file structures.
as you will see this project CSS files were divided into their respective titles.

Ideas to Improve:
i saw that the old project was with a Triangular shape. it would be nice if we could play with that aspect in this project since weve already done a circular shape in sprint 1.
the color on the header\_\_description was not in the brief. it would be nice to see that included to avoid a simple mistake.
i think that the brief should break down all of the dimensions and measurements in each section. after all, this is only our 2nd sprint. it would be nice to have somewhat of a refresher as to where all the paddings, margins, gaps go to.
